# Smoke-test mode configuration
# Quick verification run with small episode count and detailed logging
# This config is optimized for end-to-end validation: logging, checkpointing, and speed metrics

mode: smoke
max_episodes: 10  # Enough episodes to see periodic stats and checkpoint
max_steps_per_episode: 100
total_timesteps: 15000  # ~15k steps for reasonable runtime while showing metrics
n_steps: 512
learning_rate: 3e-4
batch_size: 64
logging_verbosity: 1  # INFO level (sufficient for smoke test, DEBUG is very verbose)
random_seed: 42
checkpoint_dir: checkpoints
tensorboard_log_dir: ./logs
checkpoint_interval_episodes: 5  # Save checkpoint every 5 episodes (will get at least 1)
keep_last_n_checkpoints: 2
enable_sanity_checks: true
log_action_details: false  # Disable detailed action logging (too verbose for smoke test)
