# Codebase Warnings & Tech Debt

Last verified: February 2026.

This document tracks warnings generated by linters (`eslint`, `ruff`, etc.) that have been intentionally left unfixed to avoid large, risky diffs or because they require deeper architectural changes.

## Frontend (React/TypeScript)

### 1. Pervasive `any` Typings (`@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`)
- **Count**: ~48 instances across `GameConfigModal.tsx`, `Play.tsx`, `gameStore.ts`, `TrainingHistory.tsx`, etc.
- **Reasoning**: Many areas of the application interact with backend Python structures (e.g., config maps, raw dictionaries) that were typed dynamically. Refactoring all of these to strict TypeScript interfaces is a large architectural task that touches almost every file.
- **Risk**: Moderate. It weakens TypeScript's guarantees, but the current implementation functional behavior matches expectations.

### 2. Missing Hook Dependencies (`react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`)
- **Count**: 1 instance in `TrainingHistory.tsx` (`fetchRuns`).
- **Reasoning**: The dependency array is likely intentionally empty to prevent infinite fetch loops, or `fetchRuns` should be wrapped in `useCallback`. A mechanical fix here risks breaking the polling or fetching lifecycle.

## Backend (Python)
- Python uses `ruff` for linting. We have resolved the majority of missing imports, unused variables, and simplistic typing issues (`UP006`, `UP035`).
- Remaining warnings (~600) are primarily `W291` and `W293` (trailing whitespace on blank lines) which were left as-is to avoid a 3000-line diff.
