/Users/tjgalloway/.matplotlib is not a writable directory
Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /var/folders/xh/8r2vr33n26x429bps081h4v80000gn/T/matplotlib-2b0ya88i because there was an issue with the default path (/Users/tjgalloway/.matplotlib); it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
